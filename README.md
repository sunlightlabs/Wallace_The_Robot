Wallace_The_Robot
=================

This is the arduino code that gave animus to Wallace the Robot at #TCamp14 .
Was compiled for an Arduino UNO .

from the comments at the top of the .ino :

```C
/*|
 || WALLACE_CODE_TCAMP14.ino
 ||
 || this controls an arduino running robotic greeter and sign holder 
 ||   wallace the robot for #TCamp14 
 || http://transparencycamp.org/
 ||
 || PIN assignments are the following : 
 ||
 || __digital PINS__ :
 || heartLED = 13
 || meterLED = 12
 || leftAntLED = 11
 || rightAntLED = 10
 || armServoPIN = 9
 || buttonPIN = 8 
 ||
 || __analog PINS__ :
 || armPotPIN = 1 
 || heartPotPIN = 0
 ||
 || LEDs must be connected to resistor on way to GRND . 
 || Servo is a 180 hitek servo .
 || button is a PULLUP . 
 ||
 || as compiled on my machine w/ arduino 1.0.5 for an UNO :
 || Binary sketch size: 6,078 bytes (of a 32,256 byte maximum)
